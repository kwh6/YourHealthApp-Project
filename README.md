#### Description:
Your health app is an app designed to help you stay healthy by tracking your calories so you can be in a good shape while being healthy as well because you are what you eat.

The idea for this app came to me when I found that a lot of the people want to loose or gain weight so they can stay healthy and have a good body shape which is all controlled by calories (nutrition)
And I knew as well that one of the main reasons for most of the diseases is caused by obesity, such as high blood pressure type 2 diabetes , strokes and the list goes on and on.
So I thought about this app.

Another goal is to show people that having that great body that they have always dreamed of and a good health is actually very simple, maybe it would be hard at the beginning but it will get easier
and easier and after you go to a gym and even start working out and see results, it will become an addiction to you!

All I hope is is that app maybe an inspiration or maybe help others have an idea about their nutrition and if you did these stuff I promise your life will be much better!

And all you have to do when you open the app is to ut your information (your gender, height, activity level, your age and weight) and after that press next.
if you want to know how many calories you need a day or how many calories you need to lose or gain weight all you have to do is to press on the profile button.
If you want to change your info you can simply click in edit info button in your profile.
if you are going to eat a meal don't forget to add this meal by clicking on food adding and adding your meal's info such as how many calories are in one serving of that meal and how many grams are there in a serving etc.
if you don't know how many calories are in that meal you can click on "don't know how many calories are in that meal" button and it well redirect you to a google search that has your meal's name snd searching for it's calories per serving.

After you add the food (meal) you'll find all of your food that you have eaten in the "what have you eaten today" button.
After you click it you'll find a list of all the foods that you have eaten and all the information about each meal.
Of course your calories decreases with how many calories you have eaten according to your meals.
Your meals that you have eaten in a day gets saved so whenever you close and open the app again it you'll find your info but before pressing next make sure that the gender and the activity level are the right ones and press next then you'll find all the meals that you have already added saved.

There is another feature which is that when a day passes your food list and your calories gets reseted automatically.
